                    <h4>What's a Star?</h4>
                    <P class="mt-5">A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held
                        together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible
                        to
                        the naked eye at night, but due to their immense distance from Earth they appear as fixed points
                        of
                        light in the sky. The most prominent stars are grouped into constellations and asterisms, and
                        many
                        of the brightest stars have proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that
                        identify
                        the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. The observable universe contains
                        an
                        estimated 1022 to 1024 stars, but most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all
                        individual stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.</P>
                    <p>
                        Stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects, as in the case of planetary
                        systems
                        and star systems with two or more stars. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit,
                        their
                        gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution. Stars can form part
                        of a
                        much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.

                    <h4>Star Formation</h4>
                    <P class="mt-5">Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. A
                        familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. Turbulence deep within these
                        clouds
                        gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under its
                        own
                        gravitational attraction. As the cloud collapses, the material at the center begins to heat up.
                        Known as a protostar, it is this hot core at the heart of the collapsing cloud that will one day
                        become a star. Three-dimensional computer models of star formation predict that the spinning
                        clouds
                        of collapsing gas and dust may break up into two or three blobs; this would explain why the
                        majority
                        the stars in the Milky Way are paired or in groups of multiple stars.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        As the cloud collapses, a dense, hot core forms and begins gathering dust and gas. Not all of
                        this material ends up
                        as part of a star â€” the remaining dust can become planets, asteroids, or comets or may remain as
                        dust.

                    <P class="mt-5">Stars are not spread uniformly across the universe, but are normally grouped into
                        galaxies along with interstellar gas and dust. A typical large galaxy like the Milky Way
                        contains
                        hundreds of billions of stars. There are more than 2 trillion (1012) galaxies, though most are
                        less
                        than 10% the mass of the Milky Way. Overall, there are likely to be between 1022 and 1024
                        stars(more stars than all the grains of sand on planet Earth). Most stars
                        are within galaxies, but between 10 and 50% of the starlight in large galaxy clusters may come
                        from
                        stars outside of any galaxy.</P>
                    <p>
                        A multi-star system consists of two or more gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other.
                        The
                        simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars
                        are
                        also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into
                        hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range
                        from loose stellar associations with only a few stars to open clusters with dozens to thousands
                        of
                        stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit
                        their host galaxy.

                            helped humans navigate through Earth . When it was dark these
                            stars would light up the sky giving people light . In addition stars
                            are very important because they make life on Earth. the most
                            important is the Sun, because without that it wouldn't be life on
                            Earth . Earth would just be a rock with ice.</P>
                        <p>
                            Stars since ancient times are discribed as forever, hope,
                            destiny, heaven and freedom.
                            They have also for us people great importance and we believe
                            that falling stars make our wishes.

                            are inspired by the star to travel to Jerusalem.

                            The first use for Constellations was probably religious. People thought
                            that the Gods lived in the heavens and that they created them. Many
                            cultures believed that the positions of the stars were their God's way of
                            telling stories. So it seemed natural to recognize patterns in the sky, give
                            them names, and tell stories about them.

                            be elements other than hydrogen and helium. Hence, the universe would be very cold and dark
                            place, bathing itself with cosmic background radiation with no life forms to be seen
                            anywhere.</P>
                        <p>
                            In the case of a star, it absorbs all radiation that falls on it, but it also radiates back
                            into space much more than it absorbs. Thus a star is a black body that glows with great
                            brilliance! (An even more perfect black body is a black hole, but of course, it appears
                            truly black, and radiates no light.)

                                    age of a star, as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The

                                    consist of the radial velocity toward or away from the Sun, and the traverse angular
                                    movement, which is called its
                                    proper motion. Radial velocity is measured by the doppler shift of the star's
                                    spectral lines and is given in units of km/s. The
                                    proper motion of a star, its parallax,is determined by precise astrometric

                                    calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated.
                                    Stars with high rates of proper
                                    motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for
                                    parallax measurements.When both rates of movement are known, the space velocity of

                                    charges induce magnetic fields, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields

                                    throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the

                                    and the amount of magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of

                                    temperatures. Coronal loops are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a
                                    star's surface into the star's
                                    outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they
                                    conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles
                                    that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.Young, rapidly rotating stars
                                    tend to have high levels of surface activity because of their magnetic field. The
                                    magnetic field can act upon a star's stellar wind,
                                    functioning as a brake to gradually slow the rate of rotation with time.

                <p>Humans have long gazed toward the heavens, searching to put meaning and order to the universe around
                  them. Although the movement of constellations â€” patterns imprinted on the night sky â€” were the easiest
                  to track, other celestial events such as eclipses and the motion of planets were also charted and
                  predicted.
                  Astronomy is the study of the sun, moon, stars, planets, comets, gas, galaxies, gas, dust and other
                  non-Earthly bodies and phenomena.
